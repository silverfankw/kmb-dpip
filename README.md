This project aims to simulate KMB Dynamic Passenger Information Panel (DPIP), displaying route destination and bus stops name.

This project is developed by React + Vite with TailwindCSS.

# Future possible update

1. KMB Route Selection (No more hardcode route data since this is just developed)
2. Resolve text overflow issue

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
